# CSFML_2D_ENGINE
This is a student project made in C.
This programme is a small 2D engine using the CSFML library (https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/csfml/index-fr.php)

Might not work on Windows and Mac (never tried leave a comment if it worked). Compile on linux using the Makefile.
The binary name is ENGINE2D.

If you see any error in the code (make debug for compiling with -g) leave a comment, I will try to fix the issue as soon as I can.
