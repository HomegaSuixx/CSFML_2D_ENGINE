# CSFML_2D_ENGINE

This is a little addon for CSFML so it's easier to use. I mostly add basic functionnality.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome !

Here you will find my project for the next 4 months, I plan on making smalls addons on the CSFML library.

It focuses on the 2D part of CSFML.

My goal with this engine is to be able to use it for any up coming game project at Epitech. So I can produce game faster and waste less time on rendering processes.
When I have a few thing ready in the engine, I will document all file so it's easier to understand how it works.


All ready in :

	FlipBooks for sprites (using sprite sheets)

	Pause the game using a clock

	Rendering_stack struct and functions

Few upcoming features :
	
	Fully functionnable Rendering_Stack

	Input handling using events

	Collision engine
