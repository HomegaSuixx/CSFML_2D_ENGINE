# OmegaEngine

This is part of my personnal interest about Game Engine.
The goal is to be able to use that "piece of engine" for one of my school project. I hope it will bring my team :

    - A simple abstraction of CSFML library

    - New data structure to work with, to make the development easier

    - A multi threaded and safe renderer (Because why not, I need to learn)

I would like to thanks Hivero (https://github.com/Hirevo) for a few of implementations of my data structure (vectors and hashmap).

If you have any questions on the code, you can create a issues.

(The current architecture of the repository is subject to change and will most likely change soon)
