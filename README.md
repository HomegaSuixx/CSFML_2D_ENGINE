# CSFML_2D_ENGINE

Welcome !

Here you will find my project for the next 4 months, I plan on making a small engine using the CSFML library.

It will be a 2D tile based engine, where the player can roam in an "endless world" and could figth monsters and explore.
If you are interrest in the understanding some part of the code or anything related to the engine you can contact me (Email adresse on Github's profil).

My goal with this engine is to be able to use it for any up coming game project at Epitech. So I can produce game faster and waste less time on rendering processes.
When I have a few thing ready in the engine, I will document all file so it's easier to understand how it works.

Few upcoming features :
	
	Few more way to handle the camera.

	Data struct for monsters/items.

	System of menus and scenes.
